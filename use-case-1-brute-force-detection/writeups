Key Findings
- Repeated failed login attempts suggest potential brute-force or unauthorized access attempts.
- The special privileges (Event ID 4672) granted just before the failed attempt could indicate that an account with high privileges was compromised or in use.
- All events stemmed from the same internal IP address (192.168.189.129), which should be investigated for compromise.
- The target was the default Administrator account – a common target in lateral movement or privilege escalation scenarios.

Reflection
This sequence highlights the importance of:
- Disabling or renaming default accounts where possible.
- Enforcing account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attempts.

Recommended Actions
- Isolate the source machine (192.168.189.129) for forensic investigation.
- Review account usage logs for Administrator.
- Audit privilege assignments and logon types.
- Implement stricter access controls and alerting mechanisms for high-privilege accounts.
