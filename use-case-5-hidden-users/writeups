Overview:
This report demonstrates how attackers create hidden or backdoor user accounts on Windows systems to maintain unauthorized access and escalate privileges. Using Kali Linux as the attacker machine and a Windows 11 VM as the victim, the process is executed remotely via `psexec.py` from the Impacket toolkit.



Scenarios Tested 🔍

1. **Create New User Account**
   Command:

   ```bash
   net user backdooruser SuperSecurePass123! /add
   ```

   This adds a new user named `backdooruser` with a strong password.

2. **Add User to Administrators Group**
   Command:

   ```bash
   net localgroup administrators backdooruser /add
   ```

   This elevates the created user to the administrators group, granting high privileges.



## Detection & Monitoring 🛡️

* **Relevant Event IDs:**

  * `4720`: User account creation
  * `4732`: User added to a privileged group

* **Splunk Queries to Detect:**

  ```spl
  index=wineventlog EventCode=4720
  | table _time, ComputerName, Account_Name, Subject_User_Name, Message
  | sort - _time
  ```

  ```spl
  index=wineventlog EventCode=4732
  | table _time, ComputerName, Group_Name, Member_Name, Subject_User_Name, Message
  | sort - _time
  ```

## Summary 📋

Creating hidden user accounts is a common attacker persistence technique. Detecting these activities through event logs and proper monitoring tools like Splunk enables defenders to quickly identify and respond to unauthorized privilege escalations and backdoor creations.
