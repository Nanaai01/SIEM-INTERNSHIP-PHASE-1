🧪 Log Tampering via Security Log Clearing (Event ID 1102)

🧭 Overview

Log tampering is a post-exploitation technique where an attacker attempts to erase their activities to evade detection. One of the most direct methods is **clearing the Windows Security log**, which immediately triggers **Event ID 1102**. This write-up documents how to simulate, detect, and respond to this activity.



🧪 Test Scenario

Environment:

* Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
* Victim: Windows 11 VM with Splunk Forwarder
* Monitoring: Splunk Enterprise

Steps:

1. The attacker gains remote access using tools like PsExec or RDP.
2. Executes the command on the target Windows system:

   ```powershell
   wevtutil cl Security
   ```

   > This command clears the entire Windows Security event log.
3. On execution, Windows generates **Event ID 1102** indicating the log was cleared.

🕵️ Detection Logic

Primary Indicator:

* Event ID 1102 — "The audit log was cleared"

Splunk Query:

```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=1102
| table _time, ComputerName, Account_Name, Message
| sort - _time
```

This query helps identify **who** cleared the log and **when** it happened.

📌 Summary

Clearing logs is a red flag for tampering attempts. Security teams should:

* Alert on Event ID 1102.
* Correlate with privilege escalation or lateral movement.
* Investigate user behavior before and after log deletion.
