🔐 SIEM MONITORING LAB



📝 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Welcome to my SIEM Monitoring Lab! This project focuses on setting up a defense lab for Security Monitoring and Log Analysis using a SIEM platform.

This repository contains multiple use cases simulating cyber attack scenarios. Each use case includes detection logic, detailed write-ups, and screenshots to help you understand how to monitor and respond to security events effectively.



🛠️ TOOLS & ENVIRONMENT

  🖥️ VMware (Hypervisor)
  🐧 Kali Linux (Attack Simulation)
  📡 Splunk Forwarder, Sysmon (Log Collection)
  📊 Splunk Enterprise (Log Monitoring and Analysis)



🚨 USE CASES

1. 🔐 [Brute Force Detection](use-case-1-brute-force-detection/)

   Detect repeated failed login attempts to identify brute-force attacks.


3. ⏰ [Suspicious Logon Time](use-case-2-suspicious-logon-time/)

   Detect login attempts outside of normal business hours.

5. 🖥️ [Lateral Movement via RDP](use-case-3-lateral-movement-rdp/)

   Identify unauthorized lateral movement using Remote Desktop Protocol.

7. 📝 [Log Tampering](use-case-4-log-tampering/)

   Detect when logs are altered or deleted.

9. 👤 [Hidden User Account](use-case-5-hidden-user-account/)

   Find unauthorized hidden user accounts on the system.
   



🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

Through this lab, I developed essential SOC Analyst skills by setting up a full defense environment for security monitoring and log analysis.
I gained practical experience simulating common attacks such as brute-force attempts, suspicious logins, and log tampering — and crafting detection techniques to respond effectively.
