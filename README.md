# SIEM Monitoring Lab

Welcome to the SIEM Monitoring Lab! This repository contains several use cases demonstrating how to detect different types of cyber attacks using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform.

Each use case simulates an attack scenario and includes detection logic, writeups, and screenshots to help you understand how to monitor and respond to security events.

## Use Cases

1. [Brute Force Detection] (use-case-1-brute-force-detection/)  
   Detect repeated failed login attempts to identify brute force attacks.

2. [Suspicious Logon Time] (use-case-2-suspicious-logon-time/)  
   Detect logins outside of normal business hours.

3. [Lateral Movement via RDP] (use-case-3-lateral-movement-rdp/)  
   Identify unauthorized lateral movement using Remote Desktop Protocol.

4. [Log Tampering] (use-case-4-log-tampering/)  
   Detect when logs are being altered or deleted.

5. [Hidden User Account] (use-case-5-hidden-user-account/)  
   Find unauthorized hidden user accounts on the system.
