üìÑ After-Hours Login Detection Lab




üß† Detection Logic

```spl
index=wineventlog source="WinEventLog:Security" (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625)
| eval LogonHour=strftime(_time, "%H")
| where LogonHour < 7 OR LogonHour >= 19
| table _time, EventCode, Account_Name, LogonType, LogonHour, Workstation_Name, ComputerName
| sort -_time
```

Explanation:

EventCode 4624**: Successful login.
EventCode 4625**: Failed login.
Logon Type 3**: Network logon (e.g., SMB access).
The `login_hour` is extracted from the event time, and the query filters for logins **outside business hours (09:00‚Äì19:00)**.


Objective

This lab simulates and detects **after-hours login attempts** from a potential attacker machine (Kali Linux) to a victim machine (Windows 11). The goal is to demonstrate how such unauthorized or suspicious activity can be captured and analyzed using **Splunk Enterprise**.

üß™ Lab Setup

| Component             | Description                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Attacker (Kali)   | Used to simulate SMB login attempts.        |
| Victim (Win11)    | Logs authentication events.                 |
| Splunk Forwarder  | Installed on Windows to send logs.          |
| Splunk Enterprise | Analyzes logs and detects off-hours logins. |

üß∞ Tools Used

* `smbclient` (Kali)
* Windows Event Viewer
* Splunk Universal Forwarder
* Splunk Search App

 Attack Simulation

An SMB login attempt was made from Kali to Windows:

```bash
smbclient -U testuser //192.168.189.150/C$
```

This triggered a Windows Security log:

* successful: EventCode 4624
* failed: EventCode 4625

üîç Detection in Splunk

The search query filters for login events outside the standard business hours (09:00 to 19:00). After the attacker attempts access in the evening (e.g., 20:45), Splunk captures the log entry and flags it as an after-hours login.

‚úÖ Outcome

Splunk successfully detected and displayed the unauthorized access attempt, showing the username, login time, and method. This validates the detection logic and demonstrates the importance of time-based access monitoring in network defense.
